# TicTacToe & RockPaperScissors (C++ Console Game)
A simple C++ console game project combining **Tic Tac Toe** and **Rock Paper Scissors**.  
After finishing one game, the program launches the next. This is a fun little CLI-based two-part game intended to practice 
object-oriented programming, game loops, conditionals, and basic AI logic in C++.

# Games Included
 ## 1. Tic Tac Toe
- You play as **X**, and the computer plays as **O**
- Smart AI:
  - Attempts to win if possible
  - Blocks your winning move
  - Picks center, corner, or random move depending on the state
  - Detects wins, ties, and supports replay

 ## 2. Rock Paper Scissors
- You vs computer in a classic best-of game
- Scores tracked for each round
- Accepts input like `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` (case-insensitive)
- Shows who is winning after each round
- Prompts user to continue or exit after each round

# How to Run
1. Open the TTTRPS.sln file in the TicTacToe/src folder using Visual Studio.
2. Build and run the project.

# Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++11 or newer

# Notes
This project was built to practice C++ fundamentals and simple game logic in a fun way!
